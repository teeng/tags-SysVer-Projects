# EE 469 - Computer Architecture I
My second class in SystemVerilog/Verilog was focused on Computer Architecture I. The ultimate objective for the lab was to eventually design a Pipelined CPU capable of executing ARM Assembly instructions. The testbenches for these instructions are in the CPU and Pipelined CPU programs.

- Lab 1: Register File - 10/14/22
> top level module: regfile.sv ||  testbenches: regstim.sv
- Lab 2: ALU - 10/28/22
> top level module: alu.sv ||  testbenches: alustim.sv
- Lab 3: CPU - 11/20/22
> top level module: cpu.sv ||  testbenches: in folder
- Lab 4: Pipelined CPU - 12/2/22
> top level module: cpu.sv ||  testbenches: in folder
