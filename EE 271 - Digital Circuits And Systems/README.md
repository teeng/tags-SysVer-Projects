# EE 271 - Digital Circuits And Systems
My first class in SystemVerilog/Verilog and Digital Circuit Design. I had the opportunity to use a physical DE-1 SoC board (with attachments) to start my deep dive into this curriculum. Here, I learned Boolean algebra and simplification methods (Karnaugh Maps), programming diverse functionality. This is an Introduction to Digital Computer Systems.

Since this is the introductory course, the first few labs are mostly tutorials. The culmination of my skills and knowledge for this class are found in my Design Project where I made a game of Frogger using the LED Array attachment to the DE-1 SoC board. If unfamiliar with this game, the player controls a frog trying to cross a busy road (with multiple lanes of alternating traffic) and reach the other side safely.
