# Modules:
1.	DE1_SoC
The DE1_SoC module is the top level-entity in the design. This module controls the outputs, LEDR[9] and LEDR[8], from the input signals of 4 total switches, SW[9], SW[8], SW[7], and SW[0]. If the input signal from the first three switches matches the UPC code for one of the given Nordstrom products that are discounted, then the output to LEDR[9] will be high. Otherwise, the output will be low. If the item is also expensive, as determined by the UPC code, and SW[0] is low, then the output to LEDR[8] will be high, indicating that the item was stolen. SW[0] represents the mark for purchased expensive items, so if SW[0] is low, then no mark was found. If SW[0] is high, then the mark was found and the item was not stolen and output to LEDR[8] would be low. The logic of the output for whether an item is on discount or not is controlled by two gates: an AND and an OR. The logic of the output for whether an item was stolen is controlled by four gates: OR, NOR, AND, and NOT. 
2.	DE1_SoC_testbench
Within the DE1_SoC module is the DE1_SoC_testbench() module, which tests every possible combination of inputs from the 4 total switches used in DE1_SoC module.
