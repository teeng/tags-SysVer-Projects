# EE 371
My third and final class in SystemVerilog/Verilog and Digital Circuit Design. In this class, I did not have direct access to a physical DE1-SoC board and instead connected virtually through the platform: Labsland. This class specifically builds off of knowledge gained in EE 271 for larger, more intricate logical systems. We also learned more about memory units and began interacting with the audio and VGA attachments of the DE1-SoC board.
